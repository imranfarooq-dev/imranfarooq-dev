## Summary  
I operate like a systems engineer, not a framework collector. Core thinking is grounded in **data structures**, **algorithms**, **mathematical reasoning**, and reproducible execution under real-traffic constraints. I care about correctness, deterministic behavior, performance boundaries, and measurable value in production — not fragile demos.  

Architecturally, I have direct experience integrating **LLMs into production services** (NestJS + FastAPI) with real traffic considerations: prompt pipelines, retrieval workflows, caching strategy, latency caps, fault-aware inference, and cost envelopes. Backend depth includes query optimization at the SQL layer, caching layers to avoid redundant compute, Kafka-based streaming for async decoupling, memory-aware microservices, distributed tracing for root-cause resolution, and observability as a first-class engineering input — not an afterthought.  

Current role: **Algotix AI** — building enterprise-grade AI and decision automation systems.

## Engineering Focus  
- C++ DSA depth  
- Backend architecture that scales horizontally  
- LLM integration with deterministic execution behavior  
- Mathematical modeling and problem solving  
- System design with predictable performance envelopes

## Work Philosophy (Precision-Based)  
I care about clarity, simplicity, and reasoning-driven decisions — not hype or “framework cargo cult.” I prefer solutions that expose reasoning, control cost, hold latency constraints, and survive traffic that is not idealized. Production systems should hold their shape under load — not collapse when assumptions are violated.

## Note
Some of the best stuff I’ve built is trapped behind NDAs and corporate vaults.  
So yes — the code that would impress you the most is the code I’m legally not allowed to show.  
Welcome to senior engineering.
