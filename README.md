## Summary  
I operate like a systems engineer, not a framework collector. My work is grounded in data structures, algorithms, mathematical reasoning, and reproducible execution under real-traffic constraints. I focus on correctness, deterministic behavior, performance boundaries, and measurable value in production rather than fragile demos.  

Architecturally, I have direct experience integrating LLMs into production services using NestJS and FastAPI, handling real-world traffic considerations including prompt pipelines, retrieval workflows, caching strategies, latency caps, fault-aware inference, and cost envelopes. My backend experience includes SQL query optimization, caching layers to avoid redundant compute, Kafka-based streaming for asynchronous decoupling, memory-aware microservices, distributed tracing for root-cause analysis, and observability as a first-class engineering input.  

Currently, I am building enterprise-grade AI and decision automation systems at Algotix AI.

## Engineering Focus  
I have deep experience with C++ DSA, building backend architectures that scale horizontally, integrating LLMs with deterministic execution behavior, applying mathematical modeling to problem solving, and designing systems with predictable performance envelopes.  

---

## Work Philosophy  
Clarity, simplicity, and reasoning-driven decisions guide my work. I do not chase hype or follow “framework cargo cults.” I build solutions that are cost-efficient, latency-aware, and resilient under non-ideal traffic. Production systems should survive chaos, not collapse when assumptions are violated.
